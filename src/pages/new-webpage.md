#The technologies discovered for this site
I had some requirements. With my nose deep down in javascript most of the time, I looked for some way to create a portfolio or blog or something to document a little about what I am doing as a developer.
## about flexbox
In my position I'm spoiled with expert collegues on css and styling, which meant that the previously hard earned skills have met a rough wakening the latest time. The flex-box styling for example.
## ease of creating content
This tool introduced rendering of markdown-files into html. It makes creation of content focused to simple syntax. Fantastic. The system builds all views programatically. Yes, a lot of effort to set up this first time, but as normal with the web it is about learn and use the efforts of many other developers. Thank you.

## node js
Always a pleasure to return to node. I'm not a backend developer, although some effort has been done in PHP. Node-js is by far the most effective backend system I've used. To extend the instructions from tutorials, examples and documentation about gatsby, some local work was done here too.
## graphql
And what an exiting future for the alternative of rest-apis! The solutions graphQL proposes seems like a superb cure to align robustness and maintenance work of dynamic data-fetching from various endpoints.

## css-in-js
Also promising. The scoped solution of css for react-components. Yes, go ahead. Import everything to javascript. Everything into react, modules and what not. The idea of collecting react-component and styling into small entities usable as lego-bricks is appealing. The connection between css and elements gets less hidden than with the ubiquitous mega-large css-sheets normally present. I like that idea. The drawback I see as a beginner in that area, is the bloating with css-css-css-css of previously clean modules, but the patterns and abstraction around this will improve. Its on me.
